<p>We chose team FVS’ project to take on and extend as it provided a very solid base, upon which we could implement our own changes. This was due to the fact that the game is very simple and not very stylised, so any creative changes we made to the game would not look out of place or be difficult to integrate cleanly. Our aim was extending the game following the requirements and adding without altering much its backbone, so that it is still easily understandable to teams that have chosen FVS for their third assessment (and for FVS itself). We wanted to focus our development on maintaining the core values that made us chose FVS, while also adding new functionality and improving playability. Therefore, our project allows further extension in Assessment 4.</p>

<a id="duss-new-added-functionality" class="anchor" href="#duss-new-added-functionality" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DUS's new added functionality</h2>

<p>In terms of implementation novelty, we implemented our original ideas stipulated in the first assessment, together with the requirements imposed for this assessment:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Obstacle system</strong>, which models real life situation of a track being under repair. When a track is blocked, the train is blocked in the station for a specific time, marked on the GUI with a sliced pizza, basically. We also implemented a new resource that allows the obstacles not become a burden in the game: the engineer. Obstacles are either player-managed (hence supporting tactical moves) or they can randomly come up on a connection.</p></li>
<li><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KLjuAgD.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Miss</strong> a turn, another resource that encourages tactical moves. When a player decides to use it against the opponent, the latest cannot do anything during that turn, but to watch the progress of their trains, if they have any on the map already. No goals or resources are allocated in that turn.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>*<img src="http://i.imgur.com/0VvuDSK.png" alt=""></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Brand new scoring system</strong>     We wanted to design and implement a much more complex scoring system which would reward players for taking on harder goals. In order to do this we need to work out the optimal route from point A to point B. This is due to the fact that in some cases on the map, two stations are very close to each other, but the route between them is much longer. For this reason we implemented Dijkstra’s algorithm to work out the optimal route distance between two stations. We could then use this value to apply appropriate scaling to all scoring.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Editing of routes</strong>, which goes hand in hand with the obstacle resource. After adding obstacles, it was found that being stuck travelling on a route which is blocked by an obstacle is extremely frustrating. Instead, there would have to be a method which would allow the train to bypass the obstacle. The most sensible way of doing this is allowing the player to edit the route of a train already in motion.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Quantifiable goals</strong>, a formal requirement that now allows a wide range of goals, each with tailored scoring systems. Bonus goals can now require a player to complete them within a number of turns, using a specific resource or going through an intermediary station on their way to the destination.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Goal nodes highlighting.</strong> Now nobody has to hover over 10 nodes in order to discover where that goddamn Bucharest lies (we have all been there), all of the nodes that are associated to a goal are visible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ability to cancel placement of resources.</strong>  When playtesting the game, it was found by a number of team members that it was impossible to cancel the placement of trains and other resources once the placement had begun. While this was fine for trains as it was unlikely that you would change your mind about train placement after having started it, with the new obstacle resources this was proving to be a significant problem. Therefore we decided to add a method of cancelling resource placement by pressing a hotkey (Escape key) during the placement process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alteration of train cursor.</strong>  When using the game, the mouse cursors that the original developers used were found to be unintuitive as to which part of the cursor actually did the clicking. Therefore we added in new cursors with small arrows in the top left hand corner which clearly indicate where it is that the cursor will act.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reversed dialog buttons.</strong>  It was found that all dialogs in the game had cancel as the left-most button in the dialog, this is the opposite to how it is on Windows, which is what the player will most likely be running the game on. In playtesting many users felt that they had to go against their instincts when they were trying to click the cancel button as they were used to it being on the other side. For this reason we decided to reverse the placement of the dialog buttons.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optimised train clicks.</strong> In the original version of the game, clicking on a station which had one or more trains on it brought up a dialog box which listed all the trains allowing the player to interact with each train. While this is useful, it seemed to make the process of interacting with a single train longer than it needed to be. Therefore we streamlined the process to automatically bring up the train dialog when there is only one train present.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mouse over trains</strong>  All trains in the game have a speed which corresponds to how many pixels per second the train can travel. This speed has a direct impact on the way the game is played as it affects how quickly a route can be completed (if at all). However, in the original version of the game the player has no way of knowing the speed of a given train other than an enemy clicking on their train which tells them the speed. Therefore it was decided that to give the player’s more information with which to make strategic choices, mousing over trains would display their speed in the top bar.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indicate connection distances.</strong>  The distances between each station is calculated by using the pixel distance between the two stations, this is a perfectly acceptable way of giving the connections distance as it would feel intuitive to the player. What was found though, was that there were some cases where the shortest distance was slightly ambiguous and we did not want players to be playing a guessing game as to which is the shortest distance. It therefore felt appropriate to include the distances on the connections when a train is being routed. In addition, since we were now displaying the distances between the connections, this added a reference point for which the player could compare the total distance of their route and how long it takes so we also included this.</p></li>
